Hello there,
This is the project of real estate price prediction and recommendation using machine learning techniques. 
I have used several mmodels like linear regression, gradient boosting,
decision tree, random forest and few others.
I have taken the dataset from one website through web scraping.
The web scraping part is not done by me.
The datasets were flats,houses,real-estate and residental land.
